# Requirements For Participation In Open Beta
In order to participate in the open beta, users need to meet a few basic requirements:

1) A familiarity with setting up either a MultiMC instance or custom Minecraft launcher instance.

2) All crash and bug reports are to be submitted to the issue tracker. Please follow the formatting guidelines, as it insures that I receive all of the information necessary to resolve the error.

3) Do not under any circumstances submit a crash or bug report to any of the individual mod developers. As per the terms of the individual mod license agreements, I will handle all errors first. If I am unable to resolve the error on my own, I will submit a report myself.
